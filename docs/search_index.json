Some history: I use R a lot for work and for side projects. Over the years I’ve collated a bunch of useful scripts, from macroeconomic analysis to quick hacks for making map legends format properly. Historically my code has been stored in random Rpubs documents, medium articles, and a bunch of .Rmd files on my hardrive. Occasionally I feel like doing things properly - and upload code to a repository on github. It doesn’t take a genius to realize this isn’t a very sustainable solution - and it also isn’t very useful for sharing code with others. It turns out 2-years of lockdown in Melbourne was enough incentive to sit down and collate my best and most useful code into a single place. In the spirit of open source, a book seemed like the most logical format. The following is a very rough book written in markdown - R’s very own publishing language. 1.1 Usage In each chapter I’ve written up the background, methodology and code for a separate piece of analysis. Most of this code will not be extraordinary to the seasoned R aficionado. The vast majority can be found elsewhere if you dig around on stackexchange or read some of Hadley’s books. However I find that in classic Pareto style ~20% of my code contributes to the vast majority of my work output. Having this on hand will hopefully be useful to both myself and others. 1.2 Additional resources The R community is continually writing new books and package documentation with great worked examples. Some of my favourites (which all happen to be written in the R markdown language) are: Geocomputation with R R Markdown: The Definite Guide R Cookbook, 2nd Edition R for Data Science Data Science in Education using R Introduction to R: Walter and Eliza Hall Institute PhD lectures notes in environmental economics and data science (University of Oregon) 1.3 Limitations I’ll be honest with you - there’s bound to be bugs galore in this. If you find one (along with spelling errors etc) please email me at charlesfcoverdale@gmail.com with the subject line ‘R cookbook for the casual dabbler.’ 1.4 About the author Charles Coverdale is an economist based in Melbourne, Australia.
